	<h3>efesa printing services</h3>
	<h4>questions</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>What and how many services in total are we gonna do? (e.g mugs and t-shirts)</li>
		<li>What sizes are we gonna do? (S,M,L,XL,2XL,3XL)</li>
		<li>What are the limitations of custom-printing? (Will our illustrator be able to handle it?) </li>
	</ul>
	<h4>sling i.d service</h4>
	Aussie will be the one to do this since pvaf doesn't allow its students to wear customized slings. of course, he will advertise it through his friends and classmates, or maybe outside his classroom (in-person). While in the midst of explaining the service, he would show samples of the sling i.d designs, and offer that he can print out a custom sling design as well. and as always, if one will buy it, he will ask the customer for permission if they're fine with taking a picture with the final product and upload it to the facebook page 
	<h4>the persuasion</h4>
	this section isnt necessary but why not. in order to get people to buy thy stuff, you need to have good communication skill, which is persuasion, the ability to convince other people to do something. from what i know, in order to persuade someone, you can first offer what you have, then ask them "What do you want?" and then proceed to say your services' qualities or its benefits (try not to exaggerate them). also use those psychological cognitive biases like the framing effect or the fake-discount (just putting false percentage of discount, stay low).
	<h4>thoughts</h4>
	1 I think we should be preparing samples or printing out trending stuff, like online games t-shirt or anime-styled t-shirts. <br>2 We need to keep in touch with the events in this country such as valentines day or sinulog or political stuff, and use those events to hook customers, we can print out candidates during politics like their numbers and full body in a white t-shirt (we might have to be assertive here, like talk to them or make the first move and advertise it to voters). <br>3  	As for the valentines day, we can do custom-service like printing our their names with heart-images, or their first-name letters in a mug. As for sinulog, best option is t-shirts with the current year number. 
	<h4>potential customers</h4>
	as dad said, we can advertise this service through connections such as family members, friends and peers. Tokito and Jaxon are good targets to go first since they are cousins, I'll talk with Tokito and Aussie will do the latter, and as for our Manoy, same case, we'd inform him about this printing business. As for my classmate, J4mes is the ideal target, he's a youtuber and is also good at editing videos. I plan to offer him to print a t-shirt using his youtube name or logo or whatever he wants.
	<h4>The facebook page</h4>
	Priority here is the logo of this business and cover photo. Since dad is going to be the one delivering the goodies, he atleast needs to take a picture with the customers and upload it to the facebook page to boost reputation and authenticity of the business. Someone also has to monitor the facebook page, meaning they will have the responsibility to respond to customers (though im pretty sure facebook has like some auto replies but still)
